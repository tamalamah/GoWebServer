                    TamaLog is a personal blog with note on my achievements and project updates. 
                    Because this (b)log is shared with others online and my want to remain anonymous, I will not being using my real name.  
                    This, along with contact information, can be found on the resume that this website was attatched to.

                    Staying true to breaking things, I want to find myself as a MalDev or security research.
                    This requires a great baseline knowledge of systems, and systems archetecture. 
                    Before I start down this path, though, I want to break into Web Development as it is much easier to find a job, and backend systems still greatly interest me.
