            <h2>About Tama</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently in college for cybersecurity and work as a Systems Analyst. 
                In highschool, I was a terrible student and was meet facing an extended stay in high school.
                In my Junior year, I was learned my school offered Dual Enrollment with a local college.
                At this point in my life, I was certain that I would work some low-end retail gig and hope that my music would take off (all things my mother wanted to hear!)
                It was upon this offer that I realized "my life plan is terrible!" and looked into the offer.
                Due to how my school was structed, you in theory can gradute in one year. 
                Over the coming six months, I completed over 2.5 years worth of credits (or rather caught up on) which made me eligable for DEA (Dual Enrollment Accademy).
                (As a side note, I met my wife here aswell).
                After getting accepted, my journey into IT started here. It started on freecodecamp.org, working with JavaScript (something I sadly didn't stick with).
                DEA is marketed as a taste of IT, and this is exactly what I needed as I had zero clue what I wanted to do. 
                After taking some classes and being involved in clubs, I thought security was for me.
                After taking a lot more classes dealing with more heavy hitting enterprise level security topics, I went back on that thought.
                I was not a fan of just using tools. There was a lack of building that I wanted from Comp Sci. 
                I am still presuing the degree, but now am self-studying to become a programmer

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Staying true to breaking things, I want to find myself as a MalDev or security research.
                This requires a great baseline knowledge of systems, and systems archetecture. 
                Before I start down this path, though, I want to break into Web Development as it is much easier to find a job, and backend systems still greatly interest me.
